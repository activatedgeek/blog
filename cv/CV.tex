\section{\sc Research Experience}

  {\bf Sports Recognition via Dense Trajectory Features} \hfill September - November, 2015 \\
  	{\em Advisor: Dr. Vineeth N Balasubramanian}, {\em Technologies: Scikit-Learn} \\
    I investigated feature extraction in videos using {\it HOG}, {\it HOF} and {\it MBH} detectors (based on optical flow analysis with {\it DenseTrack}) and represented these as Bag of Visual Words. It was trained via an {\it SVM (Chi-Squared Kernel)} on 8 sports from {\it UCF Sports Dataset} and achieved accuracy of 30\%.

  \vspace*{-2.5mm}

  {\bf eDrishti, Engagement Level Detection in Videos} \hfill January - April, 2015 \\
  	{\em Advisor: Dr. Vineeth N Balasubramanian}, {\em Technologies: Scikit-Learn, Matlab, Weka} \\
  	I built a One-Vs-Rest SVM Classifier to recognize engagement levels (high, medium or low) of viewers during a MOOC video. It involved extracting fine facial features using {\it Gabor Filters}, achieving an accuracy of 67\% on a self-curated dataset of over 200 video clips.

  \vspace*{-2.5mm}

  {\bf Partial Face Detection} \hfill August - November, 2014 \\
  	{\em Advisor: Dr. Vineeth N Balasubramanian}, {\em Technologies: Scikit-Learn} \\
  I investigated state-of-the-art methods to detect partial faces in images with more natural environments. Occlusions, illumination variations and shadows make this problem challenging. {\it Graph Based Image Segmentation and Coloring} was used for spatial similarity analysis.

\section{\sc Professional Experience}

  {\bf Author, MariaDB Service}, {\it github.com/dcos-labs/dcos-mariadb-service} \hfill September 2016 - \\
    I am building an Open Source distributed scheduler for {\it MariaDB} on top of {\em Mesos}. It enables automated scheduling, scaling and maintenance of large-scale SQL databases deployed on {\it Datacenter Operating System (DC/OS)}. I've contributed container support to the {\it Mesos Framework Java SDK}.

  \vspace*{-2.5mm}

  {\bf Co-Founder, StoryXpress}, Hyderabad, India, {\it storyxpress.co}  \hfill May 2013 - August 2016 \\
    I co-founded a cloud service for large scale automated video content creation. I led complete engineering efforts from development to deployment. This included building the core {\it Video Rendering Engine} on top of {\it OpenGL} from scratch and the enterprise API used by large organizations like {\it Target} and {\it TradeIndia}. I also handled complete deployment automation on top of {\it AWS}, {\it Azure} and {\it Digital Ocean}.

\section{\sc Selected Projects}

  {\bf Docker Consul} \hfill April 2016 \\
	I built an Open Source {\it Docker} container image to deploy a quorum management technology called {\it Consul}. It included some networking tweaks to be readily deployed to data centers. It has close to {\em 25000 pulls} since its creation.

  \vspace*{-2.5mm}

  {\bf QuickSlots v2.0} \hfill February - April, 2016 \\
  	{\it Advisor: Dr. Ramakrishna Upadrasta, Dr. MV Panduranga Rao} \\
    I built a Timetable Scheduler for the {\it Computer Science Department, IIT Hyderabad}. The input to the system is faculty's preferences and the output is a consolidated time-table. The problem was modelled as {\em Min Cost Bipartite Matching}. A mathematical formulation for edge weights was created based on factors like time and venue conflicts, student batch size and course kind.

  \vspace*{-2.5mm}

  {\bf COOL Compiler} \hfill September - November, 2014 \\
  	{\it Advisor: Dr. Ramakrishna Upadrasta} \\
  	I built a compiler for the {\it Classroom Object Oriented Language}. This included understanding and implementing the {\em Lexing}, {\em Parsing} and {\em Semantic} phases for the {\it COOL} grammar. The implementation was done in C++ and including machine code generation for the {\it MIPS} architecture.

  \vspace*{-2.5mm}

  {\bf DownloadPlus} \hfill October - November 2014 \\
  	I built a Multi-threaded Download Manager in Java. It exploited the chunked downloading feature prescribed by the {\it HTTP/1.1 specification (RFC 2616)} to allow parallel downloading multiple byte ranges of a remote file, decreasing download times. It used {\it Java Sockets} and {\it Java Threads} API.

  \vspace*{-2.5mm}

  {\bf GossipBox} \hfill September - October 2014 \\
    I built a Client-Server Chat System in {\it C++} using the {\it POSIX Socket API}. It maintained an in-memory hash table of connected clients which were kept in regular sync and automatic garbage collection once sockets timed out.

\section{\sc Technical Skills}

  {\bf Technologies}: Git, MySQL, Scikit-learn, OpenGL, React, Docker, Redis \\
  {\bf Programming Languages}: Go, Java, C, C++, Python, Node

\section{\sc Positions of Responsibility}

  {\bf Volunteer, National Service Scheme}, IIT Hyderabad \hfill 2012 - 2016 \\
    I donated clothes to {\it old-age homes}. I gave {\it lectures on Basic Science and Mathematics} to primary school students. I was actively involved in {\it planting and watering greens} around the campus and was a volunteer for the {\it campus cleanliness drive}.

  \vspace*{-2.5mm}

  {\bf Core Member, Infero}, IIT Hyderabad \hfill 2013 - 2014 \\
  	I was a Core Member of {\em Infero}, the Programming Club of IIT Hyderabad. I prepared and delivered presentations on {\em Introduction to C} and {\em Introduction to Python} to freshmen. My team also introduced {\it Code Nights} to encourage Competitive Programming in the student community. We won the {\em Best Sci-Tech Club Award} for these contributions.

  \vspace*{-2.5mm}

  {\bf Events Manager, Entrepreneurship Cell}, IIT Hyderabad \hfill 2013 - 2014 \\
    I was responsible for managing campus and city-wide events for the club. My team introduced the {\em first ever lecture series} called {\it Spark} which invited successful entrepreneurs for lectures and interaction. I also drafted a {\it Business Plan Competition} as a part of the technical fest.
