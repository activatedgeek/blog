\section{\sc Research Experience}
  {\bf Food Volume Estimation} \hfill July 2017 - present \\
    {\em Advisor: Prof. Dennis Shasha, New York University} \\
    I am building an end-to-end pipeline of food volume estimation from a given set of images of food, for dietary purposes. Using generated interest points, I am investigating techniques for 3D Pose Estimation and Visual Inertial Odometry to approximate shape of the food.
