This page details the tools powering this website.

The pages are generated by [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) which abstracts
away the build process for me. All the page layouts are built in [React](https://reactjs.org) using
[Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com) _styled components_. I'm using a preset theme from
[Tailwind](https://theme-ui.com/presets/tailwind) [^1].

All content is written in extended markdown via [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) and [Remark](https://remark.js.org).

Math is rendered via [KaTeX](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX) and I've written
[a custom plugin](https://github.com/activatedgeek/website/tree/master/plugins)
to render [BibTeX](http://www.bibtex.org) using [Citation.js](https://citation.js.org).
Images are lazy loaded via React hooks, which is also implemented as a tiny plugin.

Search is powered by [FlexSearch](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch) [^2].
I use [Vega Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) to embed charts, allowing
me to use the same specification across both Python and the web.

The website is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) and the domain
registrar is [Google Domains](https://domains.google). Simple and private
analytics are powered by [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com).

The complete source is available on [Github](https://github.com/activatedgeek/website).

## Footnotes

[^1]: Still finalizing on a minimimal color palette that I can stick to and get rid of external theme dependencies.
[^2]: Albeit experimental and not satisfactory for now.
