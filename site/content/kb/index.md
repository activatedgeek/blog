## What?

This is going to be my outlet of \(more than\) thought fragments, allowing me for
a space to keep concepts/ideas in hibernation which I hopefully return to in the future.

## Why?

This Knowledge Base is an attempt to build a personal repository of items that
I either care about or would like to work on in the future. There is much value
in revisiting past but with new found means and knowledge.

For now, this remains a flat heirarchy of items. I typically collect items into
[Notion](https://www.notion.so) and then port them over to this website.

### Acknowledgments

This was inspired by the verbose collection of [Nikita Voloboev](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz).
[Alexey Guzey](https://guzey.com/) and [Patrick Collison](https://patrickcollison.com)
maintain very insightful websites. [The Farnam Street](https://fs.blog/about/)
podcast by Shane Parrish is also an excellent resource on mental models which has
finally led me to undertake this exercise.

## How?

See [The Stack](/stack) to get a sense of how I am building this. I'm still
working on improving text-based search. For now, my code editor allows
easy search since all content is mostly text.
