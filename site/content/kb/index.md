## What?

This is going to be my outlet of \(more than\) thought fragments, allowing me for
a space to keep concepts/ideas in hibernation which I hopefully return to in the future.

## Why?

This Knowledge Base is an attempt to build a personal repository of items that
I either care about or would like to work on in the future. I think there is
much value in revisiting ideas that I've had at some point in the past but with
new found means and knowledge to work on them better.

For most other purposes, this is a fairly flat and unorganized outlet of items.
I typically collect items into [Notion](https://www.notion.so) as I come across
them.

## How?

See [The Stack](/stack) to get a sense of how I am building this. I'm still
working on improving text-based search. For now, anything that strikes me easily
searchable from the comfort of my code editor as everything is pretty much plain
text for the most part.

### Acknowledgments

This was inspired by the verbose collection of [Nikita Voloboev](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz). [Gwern Branwen](https://www.gwern.net), [Alexey Guzey](https://guzey.com/) and [Patrick Collison](https://patrickcollison.com) maintain very insightful websites. [The Farnam Street](https://fs.blog/about/) podcast by Shane Parrish is also an excellent resource on mental models which has finally led me to undertake this exercise.
