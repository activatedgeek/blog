I think at some point, it is going to be worthwhile to map an extensive value chain from raw materials to finished products. Meanwhile, I'm collecting a flat list of items.

## Organisms

- CO$_2$
- Key macronutrients - NPK
- CaCO$_3$ (calcite/aragonite) - marine biomineralizers
- Si(OH)$_4$ (silicic acid) - opal structures

## Prehistoric

- Obsidian, flint - cutting, piercing
- Basalt, rhyolite, greenstone - pounding, pulverizing
- yew, white ash, black locust, osage orange - bows
- quicklime CaO - pottery
- hydrated lime - whitewash, mortar, plaster
- Cotton, wool

## Medieval

- Silt, Limestone
- Copper, Tin - ornaments, military
- Iron - tools, weapons, nails for ships, houses houses
- Clay Bricks
