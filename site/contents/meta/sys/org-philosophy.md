This website is an organization of all my knowledge. With the growing collection
of information, I've realized that I need a system to make sure it doesn't become
a large disconnected pile of text. Organizing also keeps the learning disciplined.
Albeit, content organization is tricky. Organizing too little is as good as nothing
and organizing too much becomes an categorization hell.

Outlining a core philosophy of content organization forces us to contemplate on
what is needed now and how to robustly accomodate future requirements.
