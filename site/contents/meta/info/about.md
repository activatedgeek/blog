I do [_normal science_](https://www.uky.edu/~eushe2/Pajares/Kuhn.html).

I am pursuing a PhD, advised by [Andrew Gordon Wilson](https://cims.nyu.edu/~andrewgw/),
primarily interested in scaling up probabilistic inference and advancing
reinforcement learning.

I was at [Uber AI Labs](https://www.uber.com/us/en/uberai/),
mostly working on approximate inference with [Thang Bui](https://thangbui.github.io)
and [Theofanis Karaletsos](http://karaletsos.com). Before this, I completed my
Masters thesis on how to [leverage communication for efficient Monte
Carlo sampling](https://u.perhapsbay.es/msthesis), advised by [Joan Bruna](https://cims.nyu.edu/~bruna/)
in the [CILVR](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/) lab.

In a previous life, I co-founded [StoryXpress](https://storyxpress.co/) where we
automated video creation for businesses. My co-founders carry much of the work
forward now and are [killing it](https://www.forbes.com/profile/storyxpress/?list=30under30-asia-media-marketing-advertising#22c9b8ad1f85)!

For a longer background, see my [CV](https://u.perhapsbay.es/cv). I also maintain a [knowledge base](/kb).

I'd love to collaborate on some of [these](/kb/ml-fragments) ideas. Even if
you have ideas of your own, please don't hesitate to reach out!
