I do [_normal science_](https://www.uky.edu/~eushe2/Pajares/Kuhn.html).

I am pursuing a PhD, advised by [Andrew Gordon Wilson](https://cims.nyu.edu/~andrewgw/),
interested in scaling up probabilistic inference and advancing
reinforcement learning. I'd love to collaborate on some of [these idea fragments](/kb/ml-fragments).
Even if you have ideas of your own, please don't hesitate to reach out!

Before this, I was at [Uber AI Labs](https://www.uber.com/us/en/uberai/),
mostly working on approximate inference with [Thang Bui](https://thangbui.github.io)
and [Theofanis Karaletsos](http://karaletsos.com). I completed my
Masters thesis on how to [leverage communication for efficient Monte
Carlo sampling](https://u.perhapsbay.es/msthesis), advised by [Joan Bruna](https://cims.nyu.edu/~bruna/)
in the [CILVR](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/) lab.

In a previous life, I co-founded [StoryXpress](https://storyxpress.co/) where we
automated video creation for businesses. My co-founders carry much of the work
forward now and are [killing it](https://www.forbes.com/profile/storyxpress/?list=30under30-asia-media-marketing-advertising#22c9b8ad1f85)!

For a formal background, see my [CV](https://u.perhapsbay.es/cv).

I maintain a knowledge base. Read my [knowledge organization philosophy](/kb/knowledge-base-organization-philosophy).
More generally, a good place to start is [here](/kb) or check out some of the
recently updated pages.
