I'm at [Uber AI Labs](https://www.uber.com/us/en/uberai/), fortunate to be working
with a [host](http://karaletsos.com) of [amazing](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/mup3/)
people, spending most of my time on approximate inference with [Thang Bui](https://thangbui.github.io). I also spent some time developing representation learning for Go-Explore with [Jeff Clune](http://jeffclune.com/).

I completed my Masters in Computer Science at [NYU Courant](https://cs.nyu.edu)
with [Joan Bruna](https://cims.nyu.edu/~bruna/) and other researchers in the
[CILVR](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/) lab. My thesis investigated how to [leverage
communication for efficient Monte Carlo sampling](https://cs.nyu.edu/media/publications/kapoor_sanyam.pdf).

Before this, I spent a few years building [StoryXpress](https://storyxpress.co/)
with my co-founders at [IIT Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in/)
(who by the way are [killing it](https://www.forbes.com/profile/storyxpress/?list=30under30-asia-media-marketing-advertising#22c9b8ad1f85))!

For a longer background, see my [CV](https://files.sanyamkapoor.com/cv.pdf).

I occassionally write on the [blog](/blog) and maintain a [knowledge base](/kb).
See the [stack](/kb/the-stack) behind this website to know the tools I use to build
this.

I also like to think of myself as a budding oenophile. Check out my wines and
notes on the [world map](//wine.sanyamkapoor.com).
