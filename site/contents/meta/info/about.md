I am **Sanyam Kapoor**, and I do [_normal science_](https://www.uky.edu/~eushe2/Pajares/Kuhn.html).

I am interested in scaling up probabilistic inference towards automated
decision-making. In a previous life, I co-founded [StoryXpress](https://storyxpress.co/) to
automate video creation for businesses, with some [great friends](https://www.forbes.com/profile/storyxpress/?list=30under30-asia-media-marketing-advertising#22c9b8ad1f85).

This website is my [_knowledge Bayes_](/kb). Check out some of the recently updated
pages, or subscribe to my [RSS feed](/rss.xml).
