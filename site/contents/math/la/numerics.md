Numerical linear algebra is where rubber meets the road. This
post collects some topics of interest to me. I aim to provide exposition
better than standard textbooks whenever I can. Often times, ideas keep
lying around deep inside 1000-page bibles.

- Hutchinson Trace Estimator
- Cholesky decomposition
  - Pivoted Cholesky decomposition
- Preconditioning
- Conjugate gradients
  - Modified Batched Conjugate Gradient Descent
- Lanczos tridiagonalization
- Kronecker-factored matrices
- Toeplitz matrices
