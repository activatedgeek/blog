I don't know if there's a way to answer this question definitively.
I believe ideas and innovation roughly follow a sine curve of progress. As a
society, we are perhaps in the second half of the downward sloped-part as of this
writing.

Interestingly, I found this website by Patrick Collison and Michael Nielsen - [https://scientificreturns.org](https://scientificreturns.org) which has a well-researched list of content.

I'll make notes at some point in the future.
