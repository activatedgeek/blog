An article on [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/06/25/the-world-should-think-better-about-catastrophic-and-existential-risks) reminds that humanity, from time immemorial, has faced existential risks either natural or man-made. [Black
Swan events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory) have dominated
major progress in societies. I believe the paranoia associated with such events
and ideas is overblown. Instead, these are opportunities to learn a lesson around
designing robust socieities of the future and minimizing life's entropy. Protecting
elitist institutions, racist ideologies and power are truly inconsequential in
the larger scheme of things. This is especially a reminder to the ones still stuck
in the means of the medieval ages.

## Risks

I'm keeping an incomplete list of existential risks to humanity here and hoping
to find opportunities to reduce entropy introduced by these events.

- [Coronal Mass Ejection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejection) (CME), [The Carrington Event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_1859_geomagnetic_storm)

- Pandemics

  - Disease X

- Giant volcanic eruptions

- Gamma rays from a nearby hypernova

- Hazardous asteroids

- Climate change

### Sci-Fi

Some risks are still being evaluated largely from an anthropolgical impact
perspective. In fact, I'd say these are more dystopian sci-fi risks, so far.

- Superhuman AI

- Bioweapons

- [Kessler Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome)

## Books
