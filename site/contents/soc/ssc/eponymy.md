There's been so many instances [^a] when I find things not being named after
the actual inventor. I finally have a name for this phenomenon.

[_Stigler's law of eponymy_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigler%27s_law_of_eponymy)
states that no scientific discovery is named after its inventor.

## Examples

- **Bayes theorem** was actually formulated and extended by Pierre-Simon Laplace.
- **Gaussian distribution** was actually invented by Abraham de Moivre.

[^a]: I forget so many right now but I'll keep adding them as I remember.
