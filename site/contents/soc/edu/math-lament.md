_Paul Lockhart_ hits the bull's eye in his essay titled [_A Mathematicianâ€™s Lament_](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf). If a musician doesn't know every tiny detail about music theory, is she really a musician in 
the true sense? If you can't build beautiful music sheets, can you really create
exceptional music? Of course, these questions are ridiculous but to wake up in a
world where this is the norm would be a nightmare.

Unfortunately, we do live in a world close to this. Pedagogy needs an overhaul.
Hoping that elementary schoolers will realize the importance of concepts later
in life is the worst way to sustain subject interest. Mathematics is taught in a
similar fashion - all the disparate pieces from geometry, number theory, algebra
and the likes are taught in a way that doesn't put them in the context of larger
picture. But this isn't some new extraordinary insight. It has always been
there. Everyone wants to solve it from teachers to politicians, or at least
they acknowledge that the problem exists.

_Ivan Illich_ also wrote a seminal essay back in 1970 titled [_Deschooling Society_](https://davidtinapple.com/illich/1970_deschooling.html).
