At some point in the past, I was regularly tasting wines from across the world.
[Vivino](https://www.vivino.com) was where I tracked everything. On top of this,
I manually curated the lat/long values of each of the producing wineries. It is
a collection of a little over a hundred unique wines. Hopefully, I can continue
building this repository in the future.

I've visualized all data on the world map at
[wine.sanyamkapoor.com](https://u.perhapsbay.es/wine-map). It looks something like
this.
