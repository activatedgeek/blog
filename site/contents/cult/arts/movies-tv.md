import TMDbMovies from "../../../../src/components/tmdb/movies"
import TMDbTV from "../../../../src/components/tmdb/tv"

For better or worse, I watch a lot of TV and movies. According to
[TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org), I've seen 800+ titles as of last writing.

Take a look at [some pretty plots](/kb/i-watch-a-lot-of-movies) on this data.

I migrated away from IMDb to TMDB, a community-driven effort. I like to think of
it as the Wikipedia for movies & TV and occasionally contribute an edit or two.
For a great place to find movies, see [agoodmovietowatch.com](https://agoodmovietowatch.com)
for human-curated lists.
