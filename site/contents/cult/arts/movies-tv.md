I watch a lot of TV and movies. According to [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org) [^a],
I've seen ~800 titles. [See all my ratings](https://www.themoviedb.org/u/snymkpr/ratings).

[Here's some pretty graphs](/kb/i-watch-a-lot-of-movies) on this data.

Since TMDB provides a pretty clean API, I'm going to list some automated listings
here soon.

[^a]: I migrated away from IMDb. TMDB is a community-driven effort (think Wikipedia for movies) and provides a rich API for free. Occasionally, I contribute an edit or two.
