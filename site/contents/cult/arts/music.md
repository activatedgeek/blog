### Casual Reading

I usually find music a distraction for deep technical reading. But for casual
reading, I'm collecting some nice pieces.

### White Noise

For more technical content, I recommend white noise combined with
noise-cancelling headphones. It really channels all the concentration. I was
apprehensive about this but after trying for a few weeks, I'm sticking with it.
Of course, there is probably a downside to long hours of headphones and will
vary across people.

[The MC2 Method](https://mc2method.org/white-noise/) has a nice free collection.
I like _Pure noise 3_. YouTube has plenty of audio as well with a visual dimension.
I like [Celestial White Noise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzjWIxXBs_s).
