## Origins of the Meme

The term "meme" first appeared in the book [_The Selfish Gene_](https://www.librarything.com/work/23538) (1976) by Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist. While reading [_A Thousand Brains_](https://www.librarything.com/work/25564520/book/198935560) (2021), I was quite surprised to learn that the term predates the internet era.

It was meant to describe something that evolves and replicates, just like
a _gene_, but through culture instead of biology. While I've now come across this concept without having been named in more than a few books, it fascinates me every time.
