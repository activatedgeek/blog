In recent times, I've warmed up to a variety of themes from history, philosophy,
economics and technology. Here's a list books that have shaped me. These are
books meant to be less technical in flavor and rather more about putting broader
perspectives in context.

See [Textbooks on Various Subjects](/kb/textbooks-on-various-subjects) for
books with more technical treatment.
