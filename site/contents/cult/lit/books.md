In recent times, I've warmed up to a variety of themes from history, philosophy,
economics and technology. Here's a list books that have shaped me. These are
books meant to be less technical in flavor and rather more about putting broader
perspectives in context.

_See [Textbooks on Various Subjects](/kb/textbooks-on-various-subjects) for
books with more technical treatment._

## Resources

[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com) is generally a good resource to find books
and get a sense of the reviews. I, however, only use it to maintain a repository
of all the books I've rated. [GatesNotes](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books)
maintains a popular collection of book reviews as well

[Very Short Introductions](https://www.veryshortintroductions.com) is a great
place for short and light reads of usually less than 200 pages. It covers a
broad array of topics. I only use this resource to get a sense of fields that
are alien to me.

## Books

Here is the complete list of books reverse sorted by year. Often some titles
may have an older publication date. The year noted below is the one I happened
to mark on my Goodreads account.
