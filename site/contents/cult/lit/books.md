In recent times, I've warmed up to a variety of themes from history, philosophy,
economics and technology. Here's a list books that have shaped me. These are
books meant to be less technical in flavor and rather more about putting broader
perspectives in context.

_See [Textbooks on Various Subjects](/kb/textbooks-on-various-subjects) for
books with more technical treatment._

## Resources

[LibraryThing](https://www.librarything.com/) is extremely helpful for managing book collection, and has a large & healthy community.
[GatesNotes](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books) maintains a popular collection of
book reviews as well. [A Book Like Foo](https://abooklikefoo.com) is an interesting
search engine for books.

I also like the mission of [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org), and ended up donating a tiny amount. I highly recommend checking them out as well, since they allow book loans.

[Very Short Introductions](https://www.veryshortintroductions.com) is a great
place for short and light reads of usually less than 200 pages. It covers a
broad array of topics. I only use this resource to get a sense of fields that
are alien to me.

## Books

Here is the complete list of books reverse sorted by year. Often some titles
may have an older publication date [^a].
