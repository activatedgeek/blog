Historically, science has made great strides because someone cared to ask,
_how much_? This is my concerted effort towards _numerical literacy_ in the modern
world. Assigning tangible quantities is immensely effective towards understanding
the metaphorical "gravity of the situation".

All values are approximate and meant to facilitate back-of-the-envelope calculations.
