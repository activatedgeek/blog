I've always wondered about stupid questions like "how many of those toilet papers were sold per household?" \(funny I actually found something [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/fzxhsc/rolls_of_toilet_paper_used_per_person_per_year_oc/fn6k3d9/)\). For all the important things in life though, it is surprising that we have so much data available out in the open. I think we live in a glorious time.

[Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org) - Research and data to make progress against the world’s largest problems

[UN Data](http://data.un.org/Default.aspx) - A world of information

[World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org) - Free and open access to global development data

[Numbeo](https://www.numbeo.com) - Numbeo is the world’s largest database of user contributed data about cities and countries worldwide. Numbeo provides current and timely information on world living conditions including cost of living, housing indicators, health care, traffic, crime and pollution.

**NOTE**: I suspect Numbeo has some data bias \(most likely upwards\) but in my limited experience has reasonable ballpark estimates.

[Unicorn Nest](https://unicorn-nest.com/dataset/) - Dataset on fundraising. Unclear how clean and helpful this is to answer questions about network effects in fundraising etc.

[OpenCellid](https://www.opencellid.org/) - The world's largest Open Database of Cell Towers.

[ESO National Grid Electricity System](https://data.nationalgrideso.com/data-groups/demand) - forecast and historic data for: electricity demand, interconnectors, pump storage pumping, wind generation and solar generation.

[The Pile](https://pile.eleuther.ai) - The Pile is a 825 GiB diverse, open source language modelling data set that consists of 22 smaller, high-quality datasets combined together.

[List of datasets for machine learning research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_datasets_for_machine-learning_research) - Suprise, surprise! Wikipedia has a list of course.

## Data Visualization

### Tools

[Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/) - [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) for JS, [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io) for Python are excellent declarative abstractions for data visualization.

[kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl) - Geospatial analysis built on top of React. I use this to host [My Wine Map](/kb/my-wine-map).
