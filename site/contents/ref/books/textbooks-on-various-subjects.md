Well-written textbooks (or even theses) are the fastest way to learn _technical_ topics that have achieved **critical mass**. Inspired by a [similarly titled post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xg3hXCYQPJkwHyik2/the-best-textbooks-on-every-subject) on LessWrong, I have my own evolving list.

For obvious reasons, I have not read most books cover to cover. I 
have, however, read a few chapters of each to be convinced that
the rest of the book would be worth reading. Often, multiple books 
cater to overlapping topics, and provide complementary strengths 
to aid understanding. When multiple books are specified within 
each (sub-)section, it is safe to assume that as a "soft" 
recommendation order.
