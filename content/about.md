I'm a Masters student at [NYU Courant](https://cs.nyu.edu) broadly interested
in Machine Learning. I work with [Joan Bruna](https://cims.nyu.edu/~bruna/)
and other researchers in the [CILVR](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/) lab. I'm also
interested in Variational Inference.

I'm passionate about Reinforcement Learning which is arguably the most general 
<d-footnote>... and perhaps the closest to human</d-footnote> formulation of a
learning problem. Safe and efficient exploration in RL is a critical piece 
to minimizing uncertainty and surpise. Recently, I've been investigating 
techniques to improve efficiency of Monte Carlo algorithms so that exploring 
high density regions becomes easier.

I take healthy code and clear expositions very seriously. [This blog](/) is an
attempt to contribute my learnings back to the community (especially for newcomers).

In the long term, I hope to see "*reliable*" Reinforcement Learning as a
centerpiece in making self-driving cars and healthcare successful.

In a previous life, I spent 3 years dabbling in the startup space, 
building [StoryXpress](https://storyxpress.co/) with my
co-founders from [IIT Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in/)
(who by the way are still killing it!). Everything I know about the
intricacies of running a business is from them.
