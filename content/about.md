I'm a Master's student at [NYU Courant](https://cs.nyu.edu) interested in 
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning and Bayesian Learning. I work with 
[Joan Bruna](https://cims.nyu.edu/~bruna/) and other researchers in the 
[CILVR](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/) lab. Recently, I've been investigating
techniques to improve efficiency of Monte Carlo sampling algorithms.

In a previous life, I spent 3 years dabbling in the startup space, 
building [StoryXpress](https://storyxpress.co/) with my
co-founders from [IIT Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in/)
(who by the way are [killing it](https://www.forbes.com/profile/storyxpress/?list=30under30-asia-media-marketing-advertising#22c9b8ad1f85))!
