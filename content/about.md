I completed my Masters in Computer Science at [NYU Courant](https://cs.nyu.edu) 
with [Joan Bruna](https://cims.nyu.edu/~bruna/) and other researchers in the 
[CILVR](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/) lab. My thesis investigated how to [leverage
communication for efficient Monte Carlo sampling](https://cs.nyu.edu/media/publications/kapoor_sanyam.pdf).

Before this, I spent a few years building [StoryXpress](https://storyxpress.co/)
with my co-founders from [IIT Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in/)
(who by the way are [killing it](https://www.forbes.com/profile/storyxpress/?list=30under30-asia-media-marketing-advertising#22c9b8ad1f85))!

Have a look at my [CV](/files/cv.pdf)

I also like to think of myself as a budding oenophile. Check out my wines and notes
